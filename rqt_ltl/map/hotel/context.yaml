# initial planning value for context variables
init:

# list of all context variables which are independent for each robot
# (need to be mentioned at init)
independent: [battery]

# function(g,b)
# g - good
# b - bad
# return True if g is better than b
compare:
    battery: g > b    # the more the better
    drinks_s1: g > b
    drinks_s2: g > b

# function(v,c)
# v - value
# c - cost
# reflect implicit cost dependency of v
# return new value of v modified based on c
cost:
    battery: v - 3*c    # battery decays proportional to costs

# context variables solely calculated from other context variables
